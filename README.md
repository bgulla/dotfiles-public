This repo contains my personal dotfiles for macOS and Linux. It standardizes shell behavior, terminal settings, and other environment tweaks across all my machines.

---

## Usage

Clone the repo into your home directory and use `make` to apply:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bgulla/dotfiles-public ~/dotfiles-public
cd ~/dotfiles-public
make dotfiles
```

The `Makefile` takes care of symlinking configs into `~` and applying defaults.

## iTerm2 Magic âœ¨

On macOS, iTerm2 is wired up to load its preferences straight from this repo so changes stay in sync automatically.  

Thereâ€™s also a bit of SSH magic: when you `ssh` to an IP address or certain hosts (like `*.lol`), iTerm will switch to a different profile with a distinct theme. That way you always know at a glance when youâ€™re on a remote box â€” and it flips back when you disconnect.  If you have custom themes and settings in iTerm, this will probably b0rk them.

Note: This is currently only targeting the `bgulla` or `brandon` user. You can override this by editing the line:
```zsh
[[ "$USER" == "brandon" || "$USER" == "bgulla" ]] # edit this line if you're not Brandon
```

## Updating iTerm2 Prefs

If youâ€™ve changed settings in iTerm2 and want to commit them back into this repo, run the following from inside your `dotfiles` directory:

```sh

# dump current prefs into repo
defaults export com.googlecode.iterm2 iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist

# make sure itâ€™s human-readable XML (not binary)
plutil -convert xml1 iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist

# sanity-check itâ€™s valid
plutil -lint iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist
```

## pfetch System Info ðŸ“Š

On first login each day, pfetch displays a minimal system information banner showing hostname, OS, kernel, memory, and more. This is configured to run once per day in interactive shells only, so it won't interfere with scp, rsync, or other file transfer operations.

### Custom Features

The pfetch wrapper adds two additional pieces of information:
- **IP Address**: Shows the primary IP address of the machine
- **Kubernetes Detection**: Automatically detects if k3s or rke2 is installed on the node by checking for `/etc/rancher/{k3s,rke2}/k3s.yaml` or `rke2.yaml`

### Disabling pfetch

If you need to disable pfetch (break glass scenario), create an empty file in your home directory:

```sh
touch ~/.disablepfetch
```

To re-enable it, simply remove the file:

```sh
rm ~/.disablepfetch
```

### How It Works

- Runs only in **interactive shells** (won't break scripting or file transfers)
- Creates a timestamp file (`~/.pfetch_last_run`) to track the last run date
- Only displays once per day on first login
- Checks for `~/.disablepfetch` file before running

These dotfiles are meant to be portable, easy to apply, and give me a consistent environment no matter where I'm working.
