This repo contains my personal dotfiles for macOS and Linux. It standardizes shell behavior, terminal settings, and other environment tweaks across all my machines.

## Usage

Clone the repo into your home directory and use `make` to apply:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bgulla/dotfiles-public ~/dotfiles-public
cd ~/dotfiles-public
make dotfiles
```

The `Makefile` takes care of symlinking configs into `~` and applying defaults.

## iTerm2 Magic âœ¨

On macOS, iTerm2 is wired up to load its preferences straight from this repo so changes stay in sync automatically.  

Thereâ€™s also a bit of SSH magic: when you `ssh` to an IP address or certain hosts (like `*.lol`), iTerm will switch to a different profile with a distinct theme. That way you always know at a glance when youâ€™re on a remote box â€” and it flips back when you disconnect.  If you have custom themes and settings in iTerm, this will probably b0rk them.

Note: This is currently only targeting the `bgulla` or `brandon` user. You can override this by editing the line:
```zsh
[[ "$USER" == "brandon" || "$USER" == "bgulla" ]] # edit this line if you're not Brandon
```

## Updating iTerm2 Prefs

If youâ€™ve changed settings in iTerm2 and want to commit them back into this repo, run the following from inside your `dotfiles` directory:

```sh

# dump current prefs into repo
defaults export com.googlecode.iterm2 iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist

# make sure itâ€™s human-readable XML (not binary)
plutil -convert xml1 iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist

# sanity-check itâ€™s valid
plutil -lint iterm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist
```

These dotfiles are meant to be portable, easy to apply, and give me a consistent environment no matter where Iâ€™m working.
